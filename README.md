# KeyPoint detection, Panorama estimation with Homography, Epipolar geometry and Depth map

Each folder in this Repo has a main.py file, Images folder, Results folder and a .pdf report describing the Python program. Each folder represents an individual program and has been appropriately named to identify its application. Note that the program for keypoint detection using SIFT has been written using Python and Numpy (without OpenCV or other CV libraries). Other programs have been written in Python using OpenCV.
